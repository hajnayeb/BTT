# Blade Tip Timing implementation for blade vibration measurement:
**I prepared a laboratory simulator for blade vibration.** 
**Fibre-optic sensors were used to measure the blade vibrations based on a number of Blade Tip Timing (BTT) techniques.** 
**The test setup (including the shaker and sensors) is shown in the following photo:**
